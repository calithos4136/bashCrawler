# bashCrawler
a web crawler and image extractor written in bash, mainly for the website 'https://yande.re' <-- NOTE: nsfw link


Simply download the bash file crawler.sh and run it from anywhere in your terminal. 

!    When selecting the directory in the program prompts, navigate from the home directory, not the program directory.

BUGS (THAT I KNOW OF)
        -the files remaining is a negative number due to a poor arithmatec execution or a bad variable use
