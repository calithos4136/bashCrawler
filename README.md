# bashCrawler
a web crawler and image extractor written in bash, mainly for the website 'https://yande.re' <-- NOTE: nsfw link


Simply download the bash file crawler.sh and run it from anywhere in your terminal. Also use the checksum file if you want to make sure its legit. (I know it's unecessary, but if it makes you feel comfortable.....)

!    When selecting the directory in the program prompts, navigate from the home directory, not the program directory.

BUGS (THAT I KNOW OF)
        -the files remaining is a negative number due to a poor arithmatic execution or a bad variable use
